        Common Medications to Avoid in Your Cat
    </h1>
</div>
<p>
<b>Tylenol (acetaminophen)</b><br>
This seemingly safe drug used in humans for headaches and fever, 
can actually be deadly to your cat.  Cats have an unusual metabolism in their liver. When Tylenol is eaten, it is taken by 
the bloodstream to the liver.  In the cat, the liver metabolizes or breaks down Tylenol into separate components which 
are actually toxic to the cat.  In other species these components are further broken down by the liver into non toxic 
substances.  But the cat lacks the necessary enzymes to continue this breakdown process.  These end products of 
Tylenol breakdown are so toxic to the cat that death is the typical outcome.  <br>
<b>Aspirin and Pepto-Bismol</b><br>
Similar to Tylenol, both aspirin and Pepto Bismol are highly toxic when used in treating cats. Both medicines contain 
salicylates which can cause respiratory failure and hyperglycemia. <br>
<b>Sudafed (pseudoephedrine)</b><br>
Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant found in many cold remedies, but acts like a stimulant in cats who can experience 
elevated heart rates and seizures. <br>
<b>Many Prescription Medications</b><br>
Pets often snatch pill vials from counters and nightstands or gobble up meds accidentally dropped on the floor. 
Medications of particular concern are:<br>
         ¤ Prescription NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) <br>
         ¤ Antidepressants <br>
         ¤ Pain relievers like Vicodin, Tylenol with Codeine and Percocet<br>
         ¤ Ritalin (methylphenidate) <br>
         ¤ Fluorouracil <br>
         ¤ Isoniazid <br>
         ¤ Anti-diabetics like Glucophage (metformin) and glyburide <br>
         ¤ Vitamin D derivatives <br>
         ¤ Baclofen <br>
